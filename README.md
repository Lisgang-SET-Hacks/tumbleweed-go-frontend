### Tumbleweed GO
Tumbleweed GO crowdsources tumbleweed containment to the general public through a mobile app and a web app.

## Frontend
Built using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) and [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/).

This web app displays data obtained from our backend on a map in a minimal and user-friendly way. The slider allows users to view current tumbleweed positions and track their movements in the following days.
